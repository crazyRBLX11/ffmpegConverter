<h1>ffmpeg Converter</h1>

This is a simple and offline video-audio converter script for Windows NT operating systems using the ffmpeg libraries. Videos and audio files that are converted retain their filenames.

Why?: I wrote this script as practice for automation scripts. It's not meant to be used by the public as it just runs the ffmpeg commands for you, however, you can if you want.

<h4>Usage</h4>
<p>The Video Converter is run through the Windows Terminal or the CMD.
The command is "Convert.bat convert "PATH_TO_FILE" OUTPUT_TYPE". An example is 'Convert.bat "C:\Users:\USERNAME\Desktop\Example.mkv .mp4"' The file is outputted to the Output/ directory - which is automatically created if it hasn't been already.</p>

<h4>Licensing</h4>
<p>In order to remain compliant with ffmpeg licensing the converter is licensed under GPL-3.0. Source code for the ffmpeg executable used is also provided in a zip file. This software is provided WITHOUT a warranty.</p>
